this version is a update based on 'theory generation for Z machine' folder
this version is the active version
'theory generation for Z machine' folder converts functions into 'consts'
this version uses zfun/pre/post_condition pattern
this version keeps the 'consts' 
so the specified functions are transformed to zfun, e.g., intensity
unspecified to consts, e.g., analysis

Also RoboChart modeld used in this version updated the chemical.rct to specify some functions, but not all.
