this version is to modified the robostar website version to be consistent with Simon's paper
in the folder 'theory generation for Z machine', I only tried to query GasAnalysis.model using EOL
I have copied this version as a new project 'ChemicalDetector_GasAnalysis_Use_Case' in this workspace
in the new project, I will put all the elements in one rct, such as enumarate, free variables defined in module level.
